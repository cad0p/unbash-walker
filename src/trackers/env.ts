/**
 * Built-in env tracker — walker state for shell variable assignments
 * the walker can statically resolve.
 *
 * Scope (v0.1.0):
 *
 *   - ✅ Bare assignment as its own command: `FOO=value`
 *   - ✅ `export FOO=value`
 *   - ✅ `unset FOO`
 *   - ✅ Seeded from `process.env.HOME`, `process.env.USER`,
 *        `process.env.PWD` at tracker initialization (so `cd ~`
 *        and `cd "$HOME/x"` resolve on the first walk).
 *   - ❌ `readonly FOO=value` — attribute-bearing, deferred.
 *   - ❌ `local FOO=value` — function scope not modelled.
 *   - ❌ `declare` / `typeset` — attribute semantics deferred.
 *   - ❌ `source` / `.` — opaque file inclusion.
 *   - ❌ Function-body walking — function definitions don't execute.
 *   - ❌ Compound assignment shapes (skipped at the parser-prefix
 *        synthesis step in `tracker.ts:synthesizeAssignmentWords`):
 *        - `FOO+=value` (append) — no-op; a future version may read
 *          `allState.env` and do `env.set(NAME, old + value)` once
 *          multi-hop env resolution lands.
 *        - `FOO=(a b c)` (array init) — we don't track bash arrays;
 *          skipped so scalar FOO is untouched.
 *        - `FOO[0]=value` (array-index assignment) — same.
 *
 * The full deferred-scope rationale lives in the file-level
 * header above and the per-class notes on each modifier below,
 * including the trigger criteria for graduating each class out
 * of "deferred" into a future `pi-steering-env` plugin or a
 * v0.1.x additive extension.
 *
 * Subshell semantics: `"isolated"` — matches bash, where env
 * changes inside `(A; B)` don't escape to the outer scope. The
 * walker handles this generically via `subshellSemantics` on
 * every tracker.
 *
 * Prefix assignments (`FOO=bar cmd`) are NOT handled here: those
 * are one-shot env for that single command, not a shell-state
 * mutation. The evaluator's `PredicateToolInput.envAssignments`
 * surface already exposes them per-ref; plugin predicates read
 * that directly.

/**
 * Bare assignment: the "command" is an assignment-prefix-only
 * statement (`FOO=value`). In unbash's AST these appear as a Command
 * with `name === undefined` and a non-empty `prefix`. Routing them
 * into this modifier happens in {@link handleCommand} — the walker
 * synthesizes one Word per prefix entry (raw text `"NAME=VALUE"`,
 * `parts` concatenating `Literal("NAME=")` + the RHS's original
 * parts) so static-resolvability checks reflect dynamic RHS values
 * (`FOO=$VAR` → word resolves to `undefined`; `FOO=bar` → word
 * resolves to `"FOO=bar"`). The modifier registers on basename `""`
 * so the walker reaches it through the same basename-keyed dispatch
 * every other tracker uses.
 *
 * Multiple prefix assignments on one line — `A=1 B=2` — arrive
 * here as multiple synthetic Words. We process them in order so
 * both assignments land.
 *
 * Multi-hop values (`FOO=$BAR` where BAR was set earlier in the chain)
 * resolve against the modifier's threaded state. `resolveAssignmentWord`
 * receives the accumulating env (`next`), so each iteration sees
 * both prior-ref assignments (threaded via `current`) and same-call
 * prior-assignment effects (threaded via `next`). `A=1; B=$A; cmd`
 * ends with `env = {A:1, B:"1"}` at cmd.
 *
 * Dynamic values that can't be resolved — command substitution
 * (`FOO=$(pwd)`), arithmetic (`FOO=$((1+2))`), unknown vars
 * (`FOO=$UNDEFINED`) — produce `undefined` from `resolveWord`, which
 * the modifier reads as "not statically known, skip". The assignment
 * is discarded from the env map; env.has(NAME) is false.
 *
 * Double-quoted values (`FOO="some value"`) resolve through
 * `resolveWord` to their unquoted inner string (`"some value"`) —
 * the Word's inner `DoubleQuoted` part concatenates static child
 * parts to the unquoted value, matching the shell's own behavior.
