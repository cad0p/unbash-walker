 * Word resolution — two exported helpers, two modes:
 *
 * - {@link resolveWord} — **value-mode**: resolves a {@link Word}
 *   to the unquoted runtime string the shell would produce
 *   (`cd "$WS/pkg"` → `/workspace/pkg`). Quotes are stripped.
 *   Process substitution `<(…)` is intractable (the fd path is
 *   unknowable) → `undefined`, and consumers (cwd tracker,
 *   envTracker assignment-RHS resolution) fail closed.
 * - {@link resolveWordText} — **text-mode**: rebuilds the word's
 *   SOURCE TEXT with every expandable part replaced by its
 *   resolved string, preserving quoting. It is a superset of
 *   `resolveWord`: everything value-mode resolves, text-mode
 *   resolves to the same string (modulo preserved quotes); on top
 *   of that it expands the words INSIDE a process substitution
 *   (`<(perl … "$BODY")` → `<(perl … "/vault/…")`), because the
 *   text form is what guardrail predicates can match against —
 *   the runtime fd path is unknowable, but the command text with
 *   variables expanded is exactly what "predicates validate what
 *   executes" needs.
 *
 * Both are pure: env snapshots come from an explicit map, no
 * `process.env` reads inside, so plugin authors can seed their
 * own env state for testing and sandboxing (the walker modifier
 * protocol hands env via the cross-tracker `allState` — see
 * {@link import("./tracker.ts").Modifier}).
 *
 * Shared scope (v0.1.0 — bundled with the envTracker):
 *
 *   - ✅ Literal, SingleQuoted. DoubleQuoted if every inner part
 *        resolves.
 *   - ✅ `$NAME` (SimpleExpansion) via env lookup.
 *   - ✅ `${NAME}` (ParameterExpansion with no operator / index /
 *        slice / replace / length / indirect) via env lookup.
 *   - ✅ Leading `~` / `~/…` via `env.get("HOME")`.
 *   - ❌ `${NAME:-default}`, `${NAME#pattern}`, … (parameter-
 *        expansion with modifiers) → undefined.
 *   - ❌ Command substitution, arithmetic expansion, ext-glob,
 *        brace expansion, ANSI-C, locale-quoted → undefined.
 *
 * text-mode only:
 *
 *   - ✅ Process substitution `<(cmd …)` / `>(cmd …)` whose inner
 *        script is a single top-level command: each inner word
 *        (name + suffix) is resolved recursively with quoting
 *        preserved, and the line is rebuilt as `<(` + joined +
 *        `)`. Nested process substitutions recurse naturally.
 *   - ❌ Inner scripts with 2+ top-level commands (pipelines,
 *        `;` / `&&` sequences) → undefined (documented limit).
 *   - ↔ When the parser could not parse the inner body
 *        (`part.script === undefined`), the part's raw `text` is
 *        contributed verbatim — nothing to expand, safe.
 *
 * Fail-closed rule (both modes): if ANY part is unresolvable the
 * WHOLE word returns `undefined` and the caller keeps the raw
 * word. Deferred classes are documented inline (see the scope
 * lists above) and graduate when a motivating use case lands; the
 * underlying AST is already typed, so adding a case is structural
 * (new `WordPart.type` arm → helper or undefined).

 * (modulo quoting), and text-mode additionally expands the words
 * inside a process substitution.
 *
 * Quoting semantics (matching bash):
 *
 *   - Literal / SingleQuoted parts contribute their raw source
 *     text (single quotes are never expanded).
 *   - DoubleQuoted parts contribute `"` + resolved children + `"`
 *     — the quotes stay so spaces inside expanded values survive

 *   - Bare `$NAME` / `${NAME}` contribute the resolved value
 *     UNQUOTED (faithful: the shell word-splits there too).
 *   - Leading `~` / `~/…` expand via `env.get("HOME")` exactly
 *     like {@link resolveWord} (first part, bare Literal only).
 *
 * Process substitution `<(…)` / `>(…)`: the inner script's words
 * are resolved recursively (single top-level command only —
 * pipelines and `;`/`&&` sequences fail closed), the line is
 * rebuilt space-joined with quoting preserved, and re-wrapped in

 * substitution, parameter expansion with modifiers, arithmetic,
 * absent `$VAR`, multi-command process substitution, …) makes the
 * WHOLE word `undefined` — callers keep the raw word.

 * @example
 *   // `--body-file=<(perl -0777 -pe '<BODY_STRIP>' "$BODY")`
 *   // with env = { BODY: "/vault/repo/prs/note.md" }
 *   resolveWordText(wordFromArg, new Map([["BODY", "/vault/repo/prs/note.md"]]))
