/**
 * Subcommand extraction — argv-structured answers to "which subcommand does
 * this invocation actually target?".
 *
 * Policy layers matching flattened command strings re-pay a "flag grammar
 * tax" on every rule: they hand-roll leading-flag skip patterns (regexes die
 * on bundled shorts like `git push -uf`, and flag values get mistaken for the
 * subcommand — `gh --hostname h pr merge` routes nowhere, `git -c KEY=VAL
 * push` reads KEY=VAL as the subcommand). The walker owns the fix because
 * the tokens are already structured: `Command.suffix` is a `Word[]` whose
 * `.value` is the quote-aware unquoted form. This module walks those words
 * structurally.
 *
 * Two surfaces:
 *
 *   - `getSubcommandWords(ref, opts)` — the subcommand run of a concrete
 *     command as a `Word[]` slice (up to `depth` words), or null when no
 *     positional remains. The per-binary position-policy table is consulted
 *     here and ONLY here: bare words carry no binary identity, so
 *     `locateSubcommandStart` takes its policy explicitly from the caller.
 *   - `locateSubcommandStart(words, opts)` — the boundary index: index of
 *     the first subcommand word in `words`, or null when no positional
 *     exists. Exported for trackers/cwd.ts; NOT re-exported from index root.
 *   - `getSubcommandRun(ref, opts)` / `locateSubcommandRun(words, opts)` —
 *     the same run as boundary metadata (`{indices, words, start}`), for
 *     consumers needing positional information (e.g. args-after-subcommand
 *     reasoning without identity-matching words). Also NOT re-exported
 *     from the index root.
 *
 * ## Design notes
 *
 *   - Linear scan over the suffix words — no regex anywhere. Each word is
 *     classified via quote-aware resolution (`.value`, never bare
 *     `.text`): any `-`-prefixed token is flag-shaped and skipped, any other
 *     token starts the subcommand run. `$VAR` values are not expanded; the
 *     scan is structural only.
 *   - Declared consuming flags are consumed by POSITION (`i += 2`), never by
 *     inspecting the following word's content: a flag value must never be
 *     evaluated as the subcommand. Attached `--flag=value` forms are single
 *     tokens by construction and need no declaration.
 *   - Position policy is a per-binary property (cobra accepts anywhere,
 *     gitcli(7) fatals on after-sub globals, mitchellh/cli errors pre-sub).
 *     Precisely scoped impossibility: ONLY `globals-after-only` binaries
 *     reject leading-global-flag shapes (`go -v build` → null; invalid by
 *     definition). For `globals-before-only` binaries post-subcommand flags
 *     are simply subcommand-owned args and extraction succeeds normally.
 *   - The null return deliberately conflates "zero positionals" with
 *     "after-only invalid shape": both mean "no extraction possible" for
 *     fail-closed consumers.
